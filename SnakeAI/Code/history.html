        <p>The Snake design dates back to the arcade game Blockade,
          [3][4] developed and published by Gremlin in 1976.
          [5] It was cloned as Bigfoot Bonkers the same year. In 1977,
          Atari released two Blockade-inspired titles: the arcade game
          Dominos and Atari 2600 game Surround.[6] Surround was one of
          the nine Atari 2600 (VCS) launch titles in the United States
          and was also sold by Sears under the name Chase. That same year,
          a similar game was launched for the Bally Astrocade as Checkmate.[7]
          The first known personal computer version, titled Worm,
          was programmed in 1978 by Peter Trefonas of the US on the TRS-80,
          [3] and published by CLOAD magazine in the same year.
          This was followed shortly afterwards with versions from the same
          author for the Commodore PET and Apple II.
